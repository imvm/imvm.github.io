description: Setting up my new blog using GatsbyJS
published: true

I wanted to have my own blog for quite a while now, as a way to showcase the things that I'm doing or learning about. I tried several different tools including Jekyll and Hugo, but never really got the ball rolling. But now, using Gatsby, I think I might finally be onto something. 

The Gatsby starter blog template is really simple and it's nice to building things with React components. With the help of their documentation I easily added some additional pages, including a paginated archive for future posts and a portfolio section for the websites and apps that I pretend on working on in the future.

I am keeping a list of ideas for future blog posts and will try to post once a month. Most of them will be about solving specific problems in mobile development or experimenting with cool new technologies.
